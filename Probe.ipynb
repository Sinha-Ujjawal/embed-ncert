      "This chunk contains information about the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic and mentions Carl Friedrich Gauss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, in this chunk we have:\n",
      "\"An equivalent version version of Theorem 1.2 was probably first recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid's Elements, before it came to be known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

      "Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855) was a German mathematician and physicist who is often referred to as the \"Prince of Mathematicians\" and is considered one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton [33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b]. He made fundamental contributions to both mathematics and science [33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b].

      "Note: The question asks for \"who was\", so we are giving a brief description. We are not inventing information. We are only using the context.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must be careful: the context says \"the first correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\". So we state that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the context gives his lifespan: 1777–1855.\n",
      "\n",
      "We write the answer in natural prose.\n",

      "Let's write it:\n",
