      "Carl Friedrich Gauss was a renowned German mathematician often referred to as the \"Prince of Mathematicians\" and one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, alongside Archimedes and Newton. He made foundational contributions to mathematics and science, particularly in number theory, where he proved the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**. This theorem states that every composite number can be uniquely factorized into primes, except for the order of the factors. Gauss first presented this theorem in his 1801 work *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*, and its proof is attributed to him [chunk ID: 33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b]. He lived from 1777 to 1855."
