      "Looking at chunk ID: 33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b, there's a mention of Carl Friedrich Gauss in the context of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. It says he is often referred to as the 'Prince of Mathematicians' and one of the three greatest mathematicians along with Archimedes and Newton. Also, the theorem is named after him because of its importance.\n",

      "Then, in chunk ID: bfa1de30-7e24-ca46-c4a4-f79ef05ae874, there's a note about HCF and LCM, but not directly about Gauss. The other chunks mention examples of irrational numbers and exercises, but not Gauss.\n",

The theorem states that every composite number can be uniquely factorized into primes, except for the order of factors.\n",

      "Carl Friedrich Gauss was a renowned German mathematician often referred to as the \"Prince of Mathematicians\" and one of the three greatest mathematicians of all time, along with Archimedes and Newton [chunk_id: 33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b]. He made foundational contributions to mathematics and science, particularly in number theory, where he is celebrated for his work on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic [chunk_id: 33ce5048-3a48-07e1-e86b-3e4fdbebbe7b]. This theorem states that every composite number can be uniquely factorized into primes, except for the order of the factors. Gauss first proved this theorem in his *Disquisitiones Arithmeticae*, establishing its critical importance to the study of integers. His work laid the groundwork for modern number theory and influenced countless areas of mathematics.\n",
